Description: Calibration of generalized linear models and Cox regression models for prediction using 
    multiple imputation to account for missing values in the predictors as described by Mertens, 
    Banzato and de Wreede (2019). Imputations are generated using the package mice without using outcomes on 
    observations for which the prediction is generated. Two options are provided to generate predictions. 
    The first is prediction-averaging of predictions calibrated from single models fitted on single imputed 
    datasets within a set of multiple imputations. The second is application of the Rubin's rules pooled model.
    For both implementations, unobserved values in the predictor data of new observations for 
    which the predictions are derived are automatically imputed. In the present preliminary (development)
    version, only binary-outcome logistic regression is supported.
